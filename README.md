# OptiCodingTest
Opti Coding Assignment: coding test given to asses current ability

#### Split into two Parts
- Part 1: stormTracker directory
	- contains the standard assignment with its own independent README
- Part 2: sampleCode directory
	- Contains a 'querier' selection of c code
	- Although not very interesting: this is part of a tiny web browser project
	- Displays my ability to work on a compartmentalized project and remain organized
	- Gives a sense of coding style
